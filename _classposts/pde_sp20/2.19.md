Based on some questions in office hours about 4.7, here is the strategy. Just like we defined energy for the wave equation and showed that it was conserved (i.e., its time derivative was 0), you are meant to define a quantity for the Schrodinger equation and show it is conserved. Here the quantity is the integral over space of the absolute value squared of u. 

It is important to note that u here is complex valued, so this absolute value squared is u times its complex conjugate, and likewise for the initial condition g.
