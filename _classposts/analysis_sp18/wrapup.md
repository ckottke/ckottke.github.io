- Please take a moment to (anonymously) fill out the [exit survey](https://goo.gl/forms/cIAYqtz7L4c7YDrm2) on the Moore method. I am very interested in your feedback on how to improve it for future iterations of the class!
- Also, Problem 5 of the [final exam problems](final_problems.pdf) on Taylor's Theorem has been updated to specialize to the case of 2 dimensions, so you don't have to worry about the multiindex notation.
