- The class will meet without the instructor this week.
- If you attend class, please send me a brief email with a short digest of what happened in class (e.g. Person A proved Theorm X. Person B gave an example for Example Y. Person C started to prove Theorem Z but got ran into a problem with Q. The class discussed the issue and came up with solution R. Etc.)
- After you finish with the inverse and implicit function theorem material, you can get started with the new Lebesgue integration material (Chapter 6).
