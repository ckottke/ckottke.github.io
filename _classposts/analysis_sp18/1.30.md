- Corrections to the series problems. As Yonathan pointed out, the p-series (1.6.8) converge if p < 1 and diverge if p >= 1. As Daniel pointed out, I missed a hypothesis in the alternating series theorem (1.6.13), which should be that the a_n are decreaasing. The [Problem Set](http://ckottke.ncf.edu/analysis_sp18/script.pdf) has been updated accordingly.
