- Thanks to everyone who reported on the class activities last week. It sounds like the class was productive. 
- Despite what I said earlier, I have decided not to hold class on Monday, 4/23, during bacc week.
- I will hold my usual office hours (M,T,Th 3:30-4:30)
- Class will resume on Thursday, 4/26 with Lebesgue integration.  I will spend some time lecturing on this material during class, but not the whole time. You should prepare some of the problems (especially the motivating examples) as well.
