- *Important Note*: I completely goofed the sign in the statement of Green's Theorem in lecture today, which says 
that the line integral of Pi + Qj over a closed curve bounding a region R is the double integral of Q<sub>x</sub> -P<sub>y</sub>,
and not the other way around, as I stated it. This means that all the examples done in class are off by a minus sign!
- *Please accept my sincerce apologies for this major error and correct your notes as neccessary.*
