- *Reading*: Section 16.6, through surfaces of revolution
- *Homework*: (16.6): #1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 19, 21, 23, 25.
- To help visualize parametric surfaces, you can use [Wolfram Alpha](www.wolframalpha.com)
and enter the plot as in the following example: [3d parametric plot (u,v,u^2 + v^2), u = -1 to 1, v = -1 to 1](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3d+parametric+plot+%5Bu,v,+u%5E2+%2B+v%5E2%5D,+u+%3D+-1+to+1,+v+%3D+-1+to+1)
