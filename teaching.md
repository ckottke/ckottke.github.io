# Notes from various classes
- [Products in homology and cohomology via acyclic models](docs/acyclic.pdf).
  Mostly following Bredon's *Topology and Geometry*, and used to supplement
Hatcher's *Algebraic Topology*.
- [Ext, Tor and the universal coefficient theorem](docs/exttoruct.pdf). Used to supplement Hatcher.
- [Bundles, classifying spaces and characteristic classes](docs/bundles.pdf).
  Emphasizes the role of principal bundles and associated bundles in the
classification of vector bundles, and contains a homotopy theoretic definition
of Steifel-Whitney and Chern classes.
- [Jordan canonical form](docs/jordan.pdf).
  Filipov's brief, elementary proof of Jordan form for real and complex matrices.  
- [Row reduction and its many uses](docs/rowreduction.pdf). Used to supplement
  Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*.

# Old MIT review packets
- [18.02A review](docs/18.02a_2nd_half_09.pdf) covering the second half (IAP portion) of 18.02A, 2009.
