# New College thesis class for LaTeX
 For New College students who wish to write their thesis in LaTeX, I have written a class file which will give you all the proper formatting. Feel free to reach out to me with questions about how to use these.
- [ncfthesis](https://github.com/ckottke/ncfthesis/) project page on GitHub, including [documentation](https://github.com/ckottke/ncfthesis/blob/master/README.md). A direct link to the class file is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckottke/ncfthesis/master/ncfthesis.cls).

# Notes from various classes
- [Linear Analysis on Compact Manifolds](neu/7376_sp16/lacm.pdf). Notes on elliptic theory on compact manifolds, including spectral theory, heat kernels, Weyl asymptotics,
and a proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem by heat kernel methods.
- [Products in homology and cohomology via acyclic models](docs/acyclic.pdf).
  Mostly following Bredon's *Topology and Geometry*, and used to supplement
Hatcher's *Algebraic Topology*.
- [Ext, Tor and the universal coefficient theorem](docs/exttoruct.pdf). Used to supplement Hatcher.
- [Bundles, classifying spaces and characteristic classes](docs/bundles.pdf).
  Emphasizes the role of principal bundles and associated bundles in the
classification of vector bundles, and contains a homotopy theoretic definition
of Steifel-Whitney and Chern classes.
- [Jordan canonical form](docs/jordan.pdf).
  Filipov's brief, elementary proof of Jordan form for real and complex matrices.  
- [Row reduction and its many uses](docs/rowreduction.pdf). Used to supplement
  Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*.
