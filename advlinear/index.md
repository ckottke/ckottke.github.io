**Course Description**: This class is an advanced version of linear algebra.
"Advanced" means that we will cover more at a faster pace than the standard linear algebra
class; it also means that proofs will be a part of lectures and problems. We will
cover vector spaces; linear transformations; systems of equations and row reduction; determinants;
eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalization; inner product spaces and the spectral theorem 
for normal operators; singular value decomposition; and if time permits, Jordan canonical form.
When possible, we will emphasize applications.

It is not necessary to have had a previous course in linear algebra. However,
this course will move very quickly through the basic material, so students
without previous experience in linear algebra should be prepared to make a
significant investment of time, and should be comfortable with a proof-based
class at this level.

 
**Reading Assignments**: 
A reading assignment for each class will be posted on the course webpage and in
the Canvas course prior to each lecture. This reading should be completed
*before* the lecture. Unless otherwise specified, you will be responsible for 
all material in the reading assignment, even if it is not covered in lecture. A provisional lecture
schedule appears below.

**Homework**:
Homework problems will be assigned after each lecture, *but will not be collected*. 
Instead, a selection of these problems will appear on each weekly quiz.

**Quizzes**: There will be a 15-20 minute quiz at the beginning of lecture each
Thursday (excepting any Exam days), which will consist of two to four problems
selected from the homework problems from the previous two lectures.

**Exams**: There will be two in-class midterm exams, and a cumulative final.
Provisional dates (which may be subject to change) are as follows:

- Exam 1: Thursday, March 9
- Exam 2: Thursday, April 20
- Final exam: TBD

**Assessment**: 
Your course performance (Sat/Unsat) will be evaluated based on quizzes and exams, weighted as below.
Class participation and attendance will be reflected in the narrative evaluation.

- Quizzes: 20%
- Exam 1: 20%
- Exam 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 40%

**Policies**: A student claiming a need for special
accommodations because of a disability must work with the Counseling and
Wellness Center, which will establish the need for specific accommodations and
communicate them to the instructor.

No  student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a
day or time when he or she would normally be engaged in a religious observance
or on a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief.  Students are
expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for a class or
announced examination, in accordance with this policy, prior to the scheduled
meeting.
