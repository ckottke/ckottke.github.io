The Mathematics Department Tutoring Center is in Room 540B, Nightingale Hall.
This peer tutoring is free. Peer Tutoring appointments can be booked via MyNEU
under TUTORING. Although you can walk in, it is really best to sign up in
advance. Tutoring requests are scheduled by students in real-time and confirmed
by email. Next-day appointments must be booked by 9:00pm the previous day. It
is expected that tutoring services in the Mathematics Department Tutoring
Center will begin the week of September 15. A partial schedule will likely be
available before then, and any updates on the availability of peer tutoring
before Sep 15 will be announced in class. See 
<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/csastutoring/setting-up-appointments/">
	http://www.northeastern.edu/csastutoring/setting-up-appointments/</a>
for more
information about peer tutoring.</p>

<p>The College of Engineering also provides tutoring for Calculus. See

<p>The PDF textbook contains links at the beginning of each section to online
full-length, free, video lectures on the contents of that section. These videos
can also be accessed directly by going to:

If there is a
discrepancy between how the videos present material and how your instructor
presents material, you should follow your instructor's presentation, but you
should discuss the matter with your instructor.</p>

<p>An independent video-tutoring company, Kahn Academy, has produced a large collection
of free, short video tutorials and examples on many topics, including Calculus; the URL
