**Course Description**: 
The desire to treat objects more general than functions
arises quite naturally in physics and differential equations. For example, the
so-called "Dirac delta function" vanishes everywhere except at 0 yet integrates
to 1. Though no classical real valued function can have this property, it
appears already in the work of Fourier and Cauchy in the early 19th century on
partial differential equations. A rigorous theory of such objects--now called
distributions--developed slowly over the course of the following century,
culminating as recently as 1945 in the work of Laurent Schwartz.

Essentially, distributions are to functions what real numbers are to the
rationals. Indeed, functions may be seen as embedded in this larger category of
distributions in which many nice properties hold: for example, every
distribution may be differentiated infininitely many times, and every constant
coefficient PDE admits distributional solutions. Distributions also turn out to
be the ideal framework in which to develop the theory of Fourier series and the
Fourier transform, in which we write functions as an (infinite) linear
combination of "basis elements" as in linear algebra, where the basis elements
are "eigenvectors" of the partial derivative operators. By "diagonalizing"
partial derivatives in this way, we turn PDE problems into algebraic ones.

Besides comprising a richly interesting mathematical theory, the theory of
distributions and Fourier analysis thus have many important applications in
physics, engineering and PDE, many of which will drive our developement of the
subject.

**Prerequisites**:

- Linear Algebra
- Multidimensional Real Analysis (e.g. Real II, or permission of the instructor)
- Though not required, students with experience in PDE, complex analysis, or physics will enjoy connections to those subjects.

**Reading Assignments**: 
A reading assignment for each class will be posted on the course webpage and in
the Canvas course prior to each lecture. This reading should be completed
*before* the lecture. Unless otherwise specified, you will be responsible for 
all material in the reading assignment, even if it is not covered in lecture.

Though it won't be used explicitly, a second textbook, [*Distributions, Partial Differential Equations, and Harmonic Analysis* by Mitrea](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-8208-6) is also on reserve in the library and freely downloadable from on campus. 
This is a more comprehensive treatment of the subject (and contains a staggering
number of additional problems), for students desiring an additional resource.

**Homework**:
Homework problems will be assigned and collected on a regular (approximately weekly) basis. You are encouraged to regard office hours as a kind of homework workshop and to attend them regularly.

**Exams**: 
There will be two exams, one at the end of each module, either oral (if class numbers permit)
or written. Dates are yet to be determined.

**Assessment**: 
Your course performance (Sat/Unsat) will be evaluated based on homework and
exams. Class participation and attendance will be reflected in the narrative evaluation.

**Policies**: 
Regular out-of-class work on problems is essential to learning this subject, and for this reason *no late assignments will be accepted* without prior instructor permission.

Students in need of academic accommodations for a disability may consult with the office of Students
Disability Services (SDS) to arrange appropriate accommodations. Students are required to give
reasonable notice prior to requesting an accommodation. Students may request an appointment with
SDS in-person (HCL3), via phone at 941-487-4496, or via email at [disabilityservices@ncf.edu](mailto:disabilityservices@ncf.edu).

No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a
day or time when he or she would normally be engaged in a religious observance
or on a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief.  Students are
expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for a class or
announced examination, in accordance with this policy, well in advance of the scheduled
meeting.
