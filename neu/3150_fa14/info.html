		<h2>Description:</h2> <p> Analysis is one of the three pillars
		of modern mathematics, along with algebra and geometry. Broadly
		speaking, it is concerned with the study of functions, usually
		of one or more real or complex variables, and their properties
		such as continuity, differentiability and integrability. In
		this course, we will build up the foundational elements of
		real-variable analysis: the completeness and topology of the
		real numbers and Euclidean space, continuous functions on this
		space, and the classical theorems of single variable calculus.</p>

		<p>While some of the results will be familiar from your basic
		calculus courses, our treatment will be entirely rigorous, and you
		will develop the ability to write sound mathematical proofs.
		The course will be challenging -- you will be
		expected to spend time studying the text and solving difficult
		homework problems, many of which you will not be able to solve
		right away. Learning to do modern mathematics is not something
		which can be done passively, but rather requires active
		practice, perseverance, and patience.</p>
		


		<h2>Course Policies</h2>
		<ul><li><b>Grading:</b>

			<p>Your final grade will depend on weekly homework
			assignments and two exams (one midterm and a cumulative
			final). Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
			Letter grades will be awarded on a curve based on your
			total numerical score computed using the percentages
			above.</p></li>

		<li><b>Homework:</b>

		<p>Homework assignments will be collected weekly in class on
		Wednesdays. You are encouraged to attempt the problems as soon
		as possible --- they are perhaps the most important component
		of the course.  Collaboration on homework assignments is
		allowed, and indeed encouraged, however <em>each student must
		write up their own homework individually.</em> Please <em>cite
	your collaborators and references used</em> (apart from the textbook)
on your homework assignments.</p></li>


<li><b>Lectures and announcements:</b> <p>You are responsible for all material
covered in lecture and given as assigned reading, as well as any announcements
or changes to the syllabus made during lecture.  Such announcements, along with
the pages of the book corresponding to the day's lecture, will be posted on the
website.</p></li>

<li><b>Missed/Late assignments and exams:</b> <p>Late assignments and missed
exams are not permissible except in cases of emergency.  If you know you will
have a conflict, <em>please arrange a work around with the instructor as
	early as possible</em>. Make-up exams will be oral exams and may be more difficult
than the original.</p>

<p>Only two finals at the same time or three in one day is a University
recognized legitimate reason to be excused from taking the final at the
scheduled time.  Students with such a conflict should complete a final exam
conflict form, available on the registrar's website.</p></li>

<li><b>Grade corrections and disputes:</b> <p>Please check over your exams and
assignments when they are returned to you for any grading mistakes and they
will be promptly corrected. <em> Grade corrections will only be made for one
week following the return of an assignment.</em></p>

<p>If you have a concern about the course or the instructor that is not or
cannot be resolved by speaking with the instructor, please contact Professor
David Massey, 529NI, x5527.</p></li> </ul>

<h2>Tips for success</h2>
<ul>

	<li><b>Read the relevant material before class.</b> <p>A reading
	assignment will be posted on the website corresponding to each lecture,
	which should be completed <em>before</em> coming to class. You don't
	need to fully understand everything, but you'll find that having some
	familiarity with the subject before coming to lecture will dramatically increase
	your understanding of the material.</p></li>

	<li><b>Start homework problems early.</b> <p>The homework assignments
	are your chance to practice the techniques of the course and develop
	your skills and intuition---to really <em>absorb</em> the material.
	Make an attempt at the homework problems as soon as possible after each
	lecture, then let them roll around in your head for a while if you
	don't get them right away. Sometimes the best mathematical insights
	come after you've put a problem in the back of your mind and let it
	percolate for a bit. If you wait until the last minute to start the
	homework assignments, you will set yourself up to do poorly and
	possibly fall behind.</p></li>

	<li><b>Don't fall behind.</b><p>Confusion is a (perhaps 'the') natural
	state of learning mathematics. However it is important to identify as
	soon as possible exactly what you are confused about and address it,
	for instance by discussing it with the instructor or your fellow
	students. The concepts in a course such as this one build on each other
	very rapidly, and you want to avoid any weaknesses in the foundation
	you are constructing.</p></li>

	<li><b>Come to office hours.</b><p>This is valuable one-on-one time
	with the instructor, during which your individual questions and issues
	may be addressed. Despite what you may think, most professors 
	enjoy holding office hours, so come and introduce yourself! I'm
	personally also happy to discuss mathematics in general or anything
	else!</p></li>
