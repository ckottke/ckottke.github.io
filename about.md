# About me

I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at New College of Florida in Sarasota.
I'm originally from Colorado and spent many years living in the greater Boston area.
I attended Tufts University (interspersed with a couple years at Berklee College of Music) for my undergraduate
degree and MIT for my PhD, and had postdoctoral positions at Brown University and Northeastern University.

My research expertise is in geometric analysis, where I am interested
in a number of topics involving geometry, analysis, topology 
and mathematical physics. I teach all kinds of subjects at all levels and believe that mathematics is for everybody.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy music, cooking, and the outdoors.
