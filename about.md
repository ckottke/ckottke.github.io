# About me

I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu) in Sarasota.
I'm originally from Colorado and spent many years living in the greater Boston area.
I attended [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu) (interspersed with a couple years at the [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu)) for my undergraduate
degree and [MIT](https://math.mit.edu) for my PhD, and had postdoctoral positions at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) and [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu).

My [research](research.html) expertise is in geometric analysis, where I am interested
in a number of topics involving geometry, analysis, topology 
and mathematical physics. I [teach](teaching.html) all kinds of subjects at all levels and believe that mathematics is for everybody.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy music, cooking, and the outdoors.
