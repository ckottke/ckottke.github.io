title: "London Summer School: The Sen Conjecture and Beyond"
---

# 19 June 2017 — 23 June 2017, University College London


## Info:  
The Sen Conjecture, made in 1996 based on SUSY physics, has posed a significant challenge to analysts and geometers. The conjecture is a statement about L^2 harmonic forms on the monopole moduli spaces $M_k$.  From general facts about L^2 cohomology, this reduces to an understanding of the hyperKaehler metric on $M_k$ `at $\infty$’. In all but the simplest cases, the geometry at infinity of $M_k$ is complicated, there being different asymptotic regions, corresponding to the partitions of the integer $k$.  With the metric understood, there is still the problem of understanding the Hodge operator d+d^* on M_k with sufficient precision to prove the Sen conjecture.


There is a parallel story for the Hilbert schemes H_k of k points in C^2, and there are similar questions and answers about the asymptotic behaviour of the moduli space of Higgs bundles.  At the same time, the study of monopoles has received fresh attention from the physics community: here singular monopoles have an increasingly important role to play and has led to exciting new conjectures going well beyond the classical work of Sen.


## Goal of the School and Workshop: 
To survey the mathematical techniques that are being brought to bear in these and related problems, while also studying the recent developments on the geometry and physics of singular monopoles.
