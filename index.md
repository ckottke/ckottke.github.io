# Employment

2016-present: Assistant Professor of Mathematics, New College of Florida.

2013-2016: Research Instructor, Mathematics Department, Northeastern University.

2010-2013: Tamarkin Assistant Professor, Mathematics Department, Brown University.

PhD 2010, MIT. Student of [Richard Melrose](http://math.mit.edu/~rbm).

# Interests
	
Global, geometric and microlocal analysis; gauge theory, moduli spaces and loop spaces.
	
# Research

My research broadly concerns geometric moduli spaces and topological
invariants, especially those involving noncompact and singular spaces, with an
approach through the analysis of partial differential equations. I specialize
in the methods of geometric microlocal analysis (pseudodifferential and Fourier
integral operators on manifolds), index theory and analysis on manifolds with
corners. I am especially interested in problems set within the intersection of
analysis, geometry and topology, and in problems arising from mathematical
physics, particularly gauge theory and string theory.

Here is a full [research statement](docs/research.pdf), and a [curriculum vitae](docs/kottke_cv.pdf)

My current research projects include 

- The study of the moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles, on R^3 (with an aim of
  compactifying the moduli spaces and proving Sen's conjecture for their L^2
cohomology) and more general 3-manifolds with asymptotically conic ends.  Some
of this work is joint with R. Melrose and M. Singer.
- A construction of the Dirac operator on the free loop space of a compact
  manifold, with the goal of being able to treat it seriously as a differential
operator and eventually to understand Witten's index formula for the elliptic
genus. Joint with R. Melrose.
- A resolution theory in the category of manifolds with (possibly generalized)
  corners, which is related to the algebro-geometric theory of logarithmic
geometry (itself a generalization of toric geometry and toroidal embeddings).
Some of this work is joint with R. Melrose.


Previously, I did some work in applied mathematics on perturbation theory for
anisotropic dielectric interfaces, and before that, on large scale parallel
numerical simulation of fluid dynamics.

# Notes & other writings
		
- [*Index Theory*](docs/index_theory.pdf), notes from the 2010 [Talbot Workshop
  of Loop Groups and Twisted K-theory](http://math.mit.edu/conferences/talbot/)
This is a brief introduction to the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem for
topologists, emphasizing the role of the index as a Gysin map in K-theory,
including a discussion of spin^c structures, orientation and Dirac operators.
- [*Extension off the boundary in a manifold with corners*](docs/extension.pdf).
  This is a short note about extending vector bundles, sections and connections
smoothly from the boundary of a manifold with
corners into the interior.
