# About me

I am a Professor of Mathematics at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu) in Portland.

My [research](research.html) area is geometric analysis, where I am interested
in a number of topics involving geometry, analysis, topology 
and mathematical physics. I [teach](teaching.html) all kinds of subjects at all levels and believe that mathematics is for everybody.

I'm originally from Colorado and spent many years living in the greater Boston area.
I attended [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu) (interspersed with a couple years at the [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu)) for my undergraduate
degree and [MIT](https://math.mit.edu) for my PhD, and I held postdoctoral positions at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) and [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu).
Prior to coming to Reed, I was a faculty member at [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu) in Sarasota for nearly a decade.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy music, cooking, and the outdoors.
