			<p><b>Errata:</b> In class I tried to define the Cantor function but did not do so correctly. 
			Wikipedia has a decent article on the <a
			href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_function">actual
			Cantor function</a>. I also asserted incorrectly that
			the Cantor function was not continuous; in fact it <em>is</em>
			continuous, though this is not immediately obvious.

			<li><b>Mon 10/20: Midterm exam.</b>
			</li>

			<li><b>Wed 10/15:</b> Review for midterm. <del>If time, some of Ch 2.9: Series in R^n.</del>
			<p>Midterm will cover Ch.  1.1-1.7, except for
			liminf/limsup (second half of 1.5), and Ch. 2.1-2.8</p> 
			<p>In the exam review, I attempted the problem: "If A
			and B are closed sets in R^n, is A + B closed? Give a
			proof or a counterexample." I had thought that A + B
			was closed, but failed after several different attempts
			to prove it. </p>
			
			<p>For those of you interested in the right answer: A +
			B need not be closed! While I also failed to come up
			with a counterexample, I eventually found one online. Let A
			be the natural numbers and B be the set of (-n + 1/n)
			for all natural numbers n.  A and B are closed in R,
			but 0 is an accumulation point of A + B which is not in
			A + B.  If you add the hypothesis that one of A or B is
			also <em>bounded</em>, then A+B will be closed. We'll
			be able to prove this once we've talked about compact
			sets.</p> </li>
