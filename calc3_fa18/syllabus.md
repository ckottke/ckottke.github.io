**Course Description**: This class is a continuation of Calculus I and II. We
will cover the calculus of functions of several variables and vector-valued
functions, including maximization/minimization; directional derivatives;
gradient, curl and divergence; line, surface and volume integrals; and the
classical theorems of vector calculus: Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem and the
Divergence Theorem.

**Reading Assignments**: 
A reading assignment for each class will be posted on the course webpage and in
the Canvas course prior to each lecture. This reading should be completed
*before* the lecture. Unless otherwise specified, you will be responsible for 
all material in the reading assignment, even if it is not covered in lecture. A provisional lecture
schedule appears below.

**Homework**:
Homework problems will be assigned after each lecture, *but will not be collected*. 
Instead, a selection of these problems will appear on each weekly quiz.

**Quizzes**: There will be a 20 minute quiz at the beginning of lecture each
Friday (excepting the two Fridays following Exams 1 and 2), which will consist of two to four problems
selected from the homework problems from the previous three lectures. 

**Exams**: There will be two in-class midterm exams, and a cumulative final. Dates are as follows:

- Exam 1: Wednesday, October 3, in class
- Exam 2: Wednesday, November 7, in class 
- Final exam: TBD

**Assessment**: 
Your course performance (Sat/Unsat) will be evaluated based on quizzes and exams, weighted as below.
Class participation and attendance will be reflected in the narrative evaluation.

- Quizzes: 20%
- Exam 1: 20%
- Exam 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 40%

**Policies**: 
Students in need of academic accommodations for a disability may consult with the office of Students
Disability Services (SDS) to arrange appropriate accommodations. Students are required to give
reasonable notice prior to requesting an accommodation. Students may request an appointment with
SDS in-person (HCL3), via phone at 941-487-4496 or via email at [disabilityservices@ncf.edu](mailto:disabilityservices@ncf.edu).

No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a
day or time when he or she would normally be engaged in a religious observance
or on a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief.  Students are
expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for a class or
announced examination, in accordance with this policy, well in advance of the scheduled
meeting.
