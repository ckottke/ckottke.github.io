**Course Description**:
This is a first course in the analysis of functions of a complex variable. 
While many concepts (sequences, series, limits, derivatives) mirror those from 
real analysis, the consequences of complex differentiability are strikingly
different from the real case and have important applications throughout mathematics
and beyond. 

We will cover complex numbers; sequences and series; continuity; complex
differentiability and the Cauchy-Riemann equations; complex line integrals and
Cauchy's Integral Formulas; power series and analytic continuation; Laruent series
and meromorphic functions; the residue theorem; and if time permits, additional topics
such as the Gamma and Zeta functions, elliptic functions, the prime number theorem, or conformal mapping.
 
It is helpful, though not strictly required, to have had at least one semester
of Real Analysis prior to taking this course; we will use results about
continuous functions, sequences and series, power series, total derivatives and
the inverse function theorem. If you have not had a rigorous treatment of these
topics, make sure you come talk to me.

**Reading Assignments**: 
A reading assignment for each class will be posted on the course webpage and in
the Canvas course prior to each lecture. This reading should be completed
*before* the lecture. Unless otherwise specified, you will be responsible for 
all material in the reading assignment, even if it is not covered in lecture.

**Homework**:
Homework problems will be assigned and collected on a weekly basis.

**Exams**: There will be two exams, one at the end of each module, either oral (if class numbers permit)
or written. Provisional dates (which may be subject to change) are as follows:

- Exam 1: Friday, October 12
- Exam 2: TBD during finals week (December 10-14)

**Assessment**: 
Your course performance (Sat/Unsat) will be evaluated based on homework and
exams, weighted equally (1/3 homework, 1/3 Exam 1, 1/3 Exam 2).  Class
participation and attendance will be reflected in the narrative evaluation.

**Policies**: 
Students in need of academic accommodations for a disability may consult with the office of Students
Disability Services (SDS) to arrange appropriate accommodations. Students are required to give
reasonable notice prior to requesting an accommodation. Students may request an appointment with
SDS in-person (HCL3), via phone at 941-487-4496, or via email at [disabilityservices@ncf.edu](mailto:disabilityservices@ncf.edu).

No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a
day or time when he or she would normally be engaged in a religious observance
or on a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief.  Students are
expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for a class or
announced examination, in accordance with this policy, well in advance of the scheduled
meeting.
