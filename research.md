# Research

I work primarily in [geometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_analysis) and [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics)),
with a focus on noncompact and singular spaces.
I specialize in the methods of microlocal analysis (pseudodifferential 
operators on manifolds), index theory, and analysis on manifolds with
corners. I am particularly interested in problems set within the intersection of
analysis, geometry, and topology, and in problems arising from mathematical
physics, particularly gauge theory and string theory.


My current research projects include 

- Analysis of noncompact [hyperkahler manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperk%C3%A4hler_manifold).
Examples of these include moduli spaces of [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomolny_equations) on R^3, 
[Higgs bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchin's_equations) on surfaces, and 
Nakajima quiver varieties, including Hilbert schemes of points on C^2.
In collaboration with F. Rochon, I have developed
a framework for analysis on many of these spaces as 'quasi-fibered boundary (QFB)' manifolds,
which has led to progress (and in some cases resolution) of long standing conjectures
for their [L^2-cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C2%B2_cohomology).
- As part of the above, constructing [compactifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(mathematics)) of the spaces in which the metrics have good behavior 
(i.e., asymptotic expansions) near infinity. My work on the compactification
of magnetic monopole moduli spaces is variously joint with K. Fritzsch,
M. Singer, and R. Melrose.
- A construction of the Dirac operator on the free [loop space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_space) of a compact manifold, with the goal of being able to treat it seriously as a differential
operator and eventually to understand Witten's index formula for the [elliptic
genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_of_a_multiplicative_sequence#Witten_genus)
of a [string manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_group). This is joint with R. Melrose.
As part of this project we developed an alternative approach to higher [gerbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_gerbe) called 'bigerbes' ('multigerbes' in general).
- Various foundational projects involving categories of manifolds with corners and their
generalizations. These include manifolds with 'generalized corners' (as defined by D. Joyce),
which bring together ideas from [logarithmic algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_structure) and manifolds with corners, and manifolds with 'fibered corners', which are equivalent
to a suitable category of [stratified spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom%E2%80%93Mather_stratified_space). In these contexts I am interested in questions about resolution of singularities
as well as the existence of categorical constructions like pullbacks, with a goal
of bringing problems on singular spaces into a framework suitable for geometric analysis.

Long ago, as a graduate student I did some work in applied mathematics on perturbation theory for
anisotropic dielectric interfaces, and before that as an undergraduate, on large scale parallel
numerical simulation of fluid dynamics.

# Notes & other writings
		
- [*Index Theory*](docs/index_theory.pdf), notes from the 2010 [Talbot Workshop
  of Loop Groups and Twisted K-theory](http://math.mit.edu/conferences/talbot/).
This is a brief introduction to the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem for
topologists, emphasizing the role of the index as a Gysin map in K-theory,
including a discussion of spin^c structures, orientation and Dirac operators.
- [*Extension off the boundary in a manifold with corners*](docs/extension.pdf).
  This is a short note about extending vector bundles, sections and connections
smoothly from the boundary of a manifold with
corners into the interior.
