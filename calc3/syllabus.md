Calculus III: Multivariable Calculus
====================================
- **Instructor**: Professor Chris Kottke
- **Office**: HNS 104
- **Email**: [ckottke@ncf.edu](mailto:ckottke@ncf.edu)
- **Phone**: 914-487-4516
- **Office Hours**: TBD
- **Lectures**: MWF 10:00-10:50, LBR 248
- **Workshop**: W 2:00-3:20, HNS 106
- **Textbook**: Calculus, by James Stewart, 7th ed.

**Course Description**: This class is a continuation of Calculus I and II. We
will cover the calculus of functions of several variables and vector-valued
functions, including maximization/minimization; directional derivatives;
gradient, curl and divergence; line, surface and volume integrals; and the
classical theorems of vector calculus: Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem and the
Divergence Theorem.

**Reading Assignments**: 
A reading assignment for each class will be posted on the course webpage prior to each lecture. This reading
should be completed *before* the lecture. Unless otherwise specified, you will be responsible for 
all material in the reading assignment, even if it is not covered in lecture. A provisional lecture
schedule appears below.

**Homework**:
Homework problems will be assigned after each lecture, *but will not be collected*. 
Instead, a selection of these problems will appear on each weekly quiz.

**Quizzes**: There will be a 20 minute quiz at the beginning of lecture each
Friday, consisting of two to four problems selected verbatim from the homework
problems from the previous three lectures. 

**Exams**: There will be two in-class midterm exams, and a cumulative final. Dates are as follows:

- Friday, September 23: Exam 1
- Friday, November 4: Exam 2
- TBD: Final exam

**Assessment**: 
Your course performance (Sat/Unsat) will be evaluated based on the formula below.
Class participation and attendence will be reflected in the narrative evaluation.

- Quizzes: 20%
- Exam 1: 20%
- Exam 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 40%
