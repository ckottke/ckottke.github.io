		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p> Differential equations are among the most powerful mathematical tools for
modeling how systems change in time. While these `systems' come from a wide
range of fields including physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, biology,
climate science, economics and pure mathematics, they may nevertheless be
treated on a common footing using tools we will develop in this course.</p>

<p>In spite of this unification however, the resulting theory is by no
means simple! We'll see that even very simple systems can exhibit an
extraordinarily complex range of behaviors, including (most famously) the
phenomenon known as chaos.</p>

<p>
Though there are many different approaches to analyzing and solving
differential equations, we take a `dynamical systems' point of view and focus
on the study of qualitative behaviors of systems such as stability, limit sets,
bifurcations and chaos rather than explicit solution techniques (which tend not
to be applicable outside of very specialized situations). The treatment will be
rigorous and proofs will be given.</p>

<p>The only formal prerequisite is differential calculus, which we will rely on
quite heavily.  As we go along we will also develop a considerable amount of
linear algebra; though no prior exposure to this is required, it may be
beneficial.</p>

		<h2>Course Policies</h2>
		<ul><li><b>Grading:</b>
		<p>
Your final grade will depend on approximately bi-weekly homework assignments
and three exams (2 midterms and a final). Letter grades will be awarded on a
curve based on your total numerical score computed using the percentages below.
Your lowest homework score will be dropped, and the final will be cumulative. 
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Homework: 30%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 1: 20%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 2: 20%</li> 
			<li>Final: 30% </li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Homework:</b>
		<p>
Homeworks may be turned in during class, or turned in to the appropriate box in
the math department mailroom, <b> by 4pm on the due date.</b>  Collaboration on
homework assignments is allowed, and indeed encouraged.  This means discussing
problems, solution techniques, and comparing individual answers, <b>not
	copying answers.</b>  Each student must write up their own homework individually.
<b>Please cite your collaborators and references used (apart from the
	textbook) on your homework assignments.</b></p></li>
<li><b>Missed/Late assignments and exams:</b>
<p>
Late homework will not be permitted, except in cases of emergency accompanied
by a note from the Dean's office.  If you have a conflict, please arrange to
turn in your assignment early, or use it as your lowest homework score to be
dropped.  A missed exam may be made up only in the case of an emergency; the
make up will be an oral exam and may be more difficult than the original.
</p></li>

<li><b>Grade disputes:</b>
<p>
Please check over your exams and assignments when they are returned to you for
any grading mistakes (they happen!) and I will be glad to correct them. <b> 
Grade disputes will be considered for one week following the return of an
assignment.</b>  After one week, the grade is set.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for success:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Read the relevant material before class.</b>
	<p>
I will put sections of the book corresponding to each lecture on the website a
day or so beforehand. You don't need to fully understand everything, but you'll
find that having some familiarity with the subject of the lectures beforehand
is extremely helpful, and you'll definitely get more out of each lecture this
way.</p></li>
<li><b> Be your own teacher.</b>
<p>You are the person in the best position to identify which things you
understand well and which things you feel a little hazy about. Try taking the
role of instructor and see if you could explain the material to someone else
(or yourself) and you'll quickly find out which things you are confused about.
While confusion is a (the?) natural state of learning mathematics (if you're not
confused about something you probably aren't doing interesting mathematics!),
don't let it persist -- work to become `unconfused'! (That way you can move on to be 
confused about something new...)</p></li>
<li><b>Come to office hours.</b>
<p>This is an invaluable time to get unconfused. Identify those things you don't
understand very well, and ask me about them -- professors like to explain
things! I'm also happy to discuss mathematics in general or anything else.</p></li>
<li><b>Think about and do math!</b>
<p>Really understanding mathematics takes time and practice. The homework
assignments are meant to give you an opportunity to dig into the material and
develop your skills and intuition.  While your lowest homework grade will be
dropped (since everybody has a bad and/or crazy week at some point), not
spending <i>any</i> time thinking about a particular assignment is a Bad Idea,
as is waiting until the night before to begin. You will get the most out of the
homework by starting early and letting the problems roll around in your brain
for a while. Sometimes the best mathematical insights come while you're walking
down the street (or in the shower!) after you've put a problem in the back of
your mind.</p></li></ul>
