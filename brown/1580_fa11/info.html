		<ul>
			<li> Midterm: Friday Oct. 21, in class.</li>
			<li> Final: Tuesday, Dec. 13, 9am.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p><b>Grading:</b>
		Your final grade will depend on weekly homework scores and exams (1 midterm and 1 final), weighted as below.  Your lowest homework score will be dropped.  The final will be about 1/3 cumulative material and 2/3 new material.</p>

		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>This class will be an introduction to the theory of mathematical cryptography.  While we will discuss symmetric key cryptography, the main focus is on the difficult mathematical problems which underlie asymmetric (public key) cryptography.</p>

		<p>These problems include the discrete logarithm problem (ElGamal and Elliptic Curve Cryptography), integer factorization (RSA) and the Shortest Vector Problem (NTRU).</p>

		<p>In the course of studying these problems, we will consider what it means for a mathematical problem to be considered difficult, what are some of the best known algorithms for solving such problems, and how they may be exploited for cryptographic purposes. </p>

		<p>Topics will include modular arithmetic, finite fields, discrete logarithms, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, ElGamal, integer factorization, RSA, an introduction to probability and information theory, elliptic curves, lattices, and digital signatures.</p>

		<h2>Course Policies:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Homework:</b>  Homeworks may be turned in
			during class, or turned in to the appropriate box in
			the math department mailroom, <b>by 4pm on the due
				date.</b>  Collaboration on homework
			assignments is allowed, and indeed encouraged.  This
			means discussing problems, solution techniques, and
			comparing individual answers, <b>not copying
				answers.</b>  Each student must write up their
			own homework individually.  <b>Please cite your
				collaborators and references used (apart from
				the textbook) on your homework
				assignments.</b></li> <li> <b>Missed/Late
				assignments and exams:</b>  Late homework will
			not be permitted, except in cases of emergency
			accompanied by a note from the Dean's office.  If you
			have a conflict, please arrange to turn in your
			assignment early, or use it as your lowest homework
			score to be dropped.  A missed exam may be made up only
			in the case of an emergency; the make up will be an
			oral exam and may be more difficult than the
			original.</li> <li> <b>Grade disputes:</b> Please check
			over your exams and assignments when they are returned
			to you for any grading mistakes and I will correct
			them.  <b>Grade disputes will be considered for one
				week following the return of an assignment.</b>
			After one week, the grade is set.</li> <li>
			<b>Calculators:</b> You may use a basic calculator
			(limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and
			division) on exams if you wish.  <b>No scientific or
				graphing calculators or smartphones
				permitted.</b>  However, the exams will be
			designed so that any computation can be reasonably done
			by hand, and arithmetic mistakes will not be unfairly
			punished when grading.</li> </ul>

		<h2>Tips for success:</h2> <ul> <li> <b>Read the relevant
				material before class.</b>  I will put sections
			of the book corresponding to each lecture on the
			website a day or so beforehand.  You do not need to
			fully understand everything, however, having some
			familiarity with the subject of the lectures beforehand
			is extremely valuable.  You will definitely get more
			out of each lecture this way.  </li> <li> <b>Come to
				office hours.</b>  Identify anything you don't
			understand very well, and ask me about it.  This is an
			invaluable time to address individual questions that
			you have; there are no stupid questions!  Also, if you
			have any questions or interests that go beyond the
			scope of this course, I'm more than happy to discuss
			these in office hours as well.</li> <li> <b>You are
				your own teacher.</b>  You are ultimately
			responsible for your own learning, and you know best
			what material you understand well and what material you
			feel a little hazy about.  Don't let yourself get away
			with the latter!  While you're encouraged to work on
			homework assignments in groups, it is your
			responsibility to make sure you're not just leaning on
			your friends.</li> <li> <b>Think about and do math!</b>
			Really understanding mathematics takes time and
			practice.  The homework assignments are not just for
			grading purposes, they're meant to give you an
			opportunity to dig into the material and develop your
			skills and intuition.  While I'll drop your lowest
			homework grades (because once in a while you'll have a
			bad and/or crazy week), not spending any time working
			on a particular assignment is a Very Bad Idea.   So too
			is waiting until Thursday night to begin the
			assignment.  You will get the most out of each homework
			by starting early and letting the problems roll around
			in your brain for a while.</li> </ul>
