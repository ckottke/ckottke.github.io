		<li><b>Due Fri 12/3.</b> <a href="psets/ps10.pdf">Problem Set 10</a>. 
		<p><a href="psets/ps10_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS10</a>.</p>
		<p><b> Update 12/1:</b> Fixed a typo in Problem I.1. The denominator of E should be rho^3 not rho^3/2.  </p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 11/19.</b> <a href="psets/ps9.pdf">Problem Set 9</a>.  Mostly stuff about Green's Theorem, plus a uniqueness theorem for 
		solutions to Laplace's Equation (the kind of thing that (some) mathematicians find exciting!).
		<p><a href="psets/ps9_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS9</a>.</p>
		<p><b> Update 11/17:</b> Fixed a typo in Problem I.3.b.  The dot product of grad f with itself is the <i>square</i> of the length of grad f.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 11/5.</b> <a href="psets/ps8.pdf">Problem Set 8</a>.  This covers improper integrals, path/line integrals and surface integrals, which
		is quite a bit.  Don't wait longer to start on it just because you have extra time.  You'll want to study for the exam as well!
		<p><a href="psets/ps8_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS8</a>.  Full solutions this time.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 10/22.</b> <a href="psets/ps7.pdf">Problem Set 7</a>.
		<p><a href="psets/ps7_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS7, Part I</a>.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the best one yet.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 10/15.</b> <a href="psets/ps6.pdf">Problem Set 6</a>.
		<p><a href="psets/ps6_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS6, Part I</a>.</p>
		<p><b> Update 10/14:</b> There was an error in the given formula for sin^4 t.  All terms should be multiplied by an additional factor of 1/2.  The
		posted version has the correction.</p>
		<p> Since Monday is a holiday, there will be no Monday office hours.  I will have extra office hours both from 11-12 and 1-2 on Wednesday.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 10/8.</b> <a href="psets/ps5.pdf">Problem Set 5</a>.  There is a Part I and a Part II, but they both fit on a single page.  
		This shouldn't be as time consuming as psets 1, 2 and 3.  (The algebra won't be as bad as pset 4 either; I actually checked this time.)  
		This is about how long psets will be from now on.
		<p><a href="psets/ps5_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS5, Part I</a>.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 10/1.</b> <a href="psets/ps4.pdf">Problem Set 4</a>.  This is shorter, with no Part I problems, so you can focus on studying for 
		Friday's midterm.
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 9/24.</b> <a href="psets/ps3_1.pdf">Problem Set 3 (Part I)</a>, and <a href="psets/ps3_2.pdf">(Part II)</a>.
		<p><a href="psets/ps3_1_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS3, Part I</a>.</p>
		<p><b> Update 9/21:</b> Typo fixed on Part I, #2.a.  The function should be e^{-1/t} for t &gt; 0 and 0 for t &lt;= 0.  Typo fixed on Part I #3.  
		The hint should index x by j, rather than i.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Due Fri 9/17.</b> <a href="psets/ps2_1.pdf">Problem Set 2 (Part I)</a>, and <a href="psets/ps2_2.pdf">(Part II)</a>.
		<p><a href="psets/ps2_1_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS2, Part I</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Update 9/14:</b> Typo fixed on Part II, #2.b.  The surface should be xyz = 1.</p>
		<p><b>Update 9/13:</b> Clarification on #1, #2, and a typo fixed in #4 on Part I. (The hint is to use your result from #3, not #4).</p>
		<p>There are some proofs again, but I think you can do all of them without any epsilons or deltas.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Due Fri 9/10.</b> <a href="psets/ps1_1.pdf">Problem Set 1 (Part I)</a>, and <a href="psets/ps1_2.pdf">(Part II)</a>.
		<p><a href="psets/ps1_1_soln.pdf">Solutions to PS1, Part I</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Correction (9/8):</b> In I.4, the speed should be ||c'(t)||, not ||c(t)||.  This has been corrected in the .pdf file.</p>
		<p>Part I contains the challenging theoretical problems for this week.  Part II is more computational.</p>
		<p>If you would like some practice with vectors, matrices and linear algebra, you can do the following optional problems (not to be handed in):
		Ch. 1.5: 1,3,5,7,13; Ch. 1 Review Exs: 11, 29.  Solutions to these odd numbered problems are in the back of the book.</p>
		<p>Since Monday is a holiday and I will not be on campus, I will have office hours both from 11-12 and 1-2 on Wednesday 9/8.</p>
