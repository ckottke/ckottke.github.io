		</li>

		<li><b>Wed 9/29:</b> Review for Exam I.
		<p><a href="ex1_topics.pdf">Here</a> is a list of topics from which Exam I questions will be taken.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Mon 9/27:</b> Lagrange multipliers with several constraints, second derivative test for Lagrange multipliers, implicit and inverse function 
		theorems. Ch 3.4, 3.5.
		<p>Just a friendly reminder that Exam 1 will take place in class this Friday, Oct. 1.  It will cover everything we've done so far, including Lagrange
		multipliers, but not including the implicit or inverse function theorems.  This corresponds to Chapters 2 and 3 of the book, except 3.5 (and also 
		not including the stuff about open and closed sets in Chapter 2).  You will also need whatever background from Chapter 1 we've been using.</p>
		<p>Note that the second derivative test (either the usual one, or for Lagrange multipliers) can only <i>confirm</i> that critical points are maxima
		or minima.  It does not rule out the possibility of maxima or minima if it fails.  I may have stated this incorrectly in lecture.</p>
		<p>My official office hours are now Mondays and Thursdays from 11-12, Wednesdays from 1-2.  I will no longer have regular office hours on Fridays.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Fri 9/24:</b> Lagrange multipliers. Ch 3.4.
		</li>

		<li><b>Wed 9/22:</b> Local and global extrema continued, second derivative test in higher dimensions, introducing Lagrange multipliers.  
			Ch 3.3, 3.4 (pp. 225-232).
		</li>

		<li><b>Mon 9/20:</b> Local and global extrema, second derivative test for max/min.  Ch 3.3, 1.3.
		<p>In discussing the second derivative test, we'll use determinants of 2x2 matrices, which is covered in Ch 1.3.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Fri 9/17:</b> Taylor's Theorem for functions of several variables, first derivative test for local extrema.  Ch 3.2, Ch 3.3 (pp. 207-210).
		<p>If you haven't yet, read Ch 1.5.  It contains a pretty good account of matrices and linear maps from R^n to R^m.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Wed 9/15:</b> Iterated partial derivatives, Taylor's Theorem. Ch 3.1, 3.2.
		</li>

		<li><b>Mon 9/13:</b> Gradients and curves revisited, tangent planes and lines.  Reading: anything you haven't yet read from Ch 2.
		</li>

		<li><b>Fri 9/10:</b> The total derivative, properties of derivatives.  Same reading as last time.
		<p>I typed up the proof of the chain rule, which you can download <a href="chain_rule_proof.pdf">here</a>.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Wed 9/8:</b> Matrices and matrix multiplication, the total derivative, properties of derivatives.  Ch 1.5 (pp. 87-83), Ch 2.3, 2.5.
		<p> Mistake: The definition I gave last time of ``differentiable'' should really have been called ``continuously differentiable'' (also known 
		as class C^1).  I'll give you the definition of differentiability on Wednesday.  By Theorem 9 (p. 137), a function which is continuously differentiable
		is differentiable, but the converse does not generally hold.</p/>
		</li>

		<li><b>Fri 9/3:</b> Limits continued, continuity, partial derivatives, gradient, curves and velocity.  Ch 2.3 (pp. 131-140 will be covered 
		next Wednesday), 2.4, 2.6, 1.1, 1.2. 		
		<p>Since Monday is a holiday and I will not be on campus, I will have office hours both from 11-12 and 1-2 on Wednesday 9/8.</p>
		<p>Since Wednesday was rather abstract, I thought we'd come down to earth for a bit and cover gradients and velocity (which are the total derivatives
		of scalar functions and curves, respectively) before we talk about the total derivative for the most general case of a vector valued function of 
		several variables, which we'll cover next Wednesday.  This is out of order with respect to the textbook, which does the general case first.  I recommend
		you read all of section 2.3, but don't worry too much about understanding everything in pp. 131-140 yet.</p>
		<p>We'll also need the notion of the dot product of vectors, discussed in 1.2.  I'll give the definition <i>briefly</i> in class, but you should 
		study the text if you've never seen this before.</p>
		<p>For those of you who were a bit uncomfortable with the function and set notation on Wednesday, have a look at p. xxvi in the book, where
		most of the notation is explained.</p>
		</li>

		<li><b>Wed 9/1:</b> Functions of several variables, limits.  Ch 2.1-2.2 (pp. 107-115 optional).  
		<p>Note that we're using the epsilon-delta characterization as the <i>definition</i> of the limit, whereas M-T use an open set definition, and then
		state a theorem that the epsilon-delta characterization is equivalent.</p>
		<p>Note also that in 10am lecture, I swapped epsilon and delta.  The definition is still correct, but it is Very Bad Form to go against the 
		usual convention, which is as stated in M-T on page 121, Theorem 6.  I'll correct this next time, and you may want to reverse these in your notes
		to avoid more confusion in the future.</p>
