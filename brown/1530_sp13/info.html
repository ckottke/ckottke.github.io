		<h2>Description:</h2> <p> This class will introduce you to
		abstract algebra -- one of the three pillars of modern
		mathematics along with analysis and geometry/topology.
		Historically, this subject grew out of the observation that
		many structures which arise over and over again in the study of
		classical mathematics and algebra can be abstracted and studied
		using just a handful of their properties, taken as axioms.
		Thus, once one has a proof about, say, groups as abstract
		objects, that proof applies to all concrete groups which arise
		in applications no matter how different they appear, from the
		permutations of the roots of a polynomial, to the invertible
		matrices under matrix multiplication, to the symmetries of a
		geometric object. We will focus mostly on the theory of groups
		and rings, with some time spent towards the end of the course
		on polynomials and fields.</p>

		<p>The class will be entirely rigorous and proof based, and
		will require quite a bit of time and effort. You will be
		expected to spend time studying the text and solving difficult
		homework problems, many of which you will not be able to solve
		right away. Working on such problems is an integral part of
		learning a subject such as this. As with speaking a new
		language or playing a musical instrument, learning to do modern
		mathematics is not something which can be done passively, but
		rather requires active practice, perseverance, and
		patience.</p>

		<h2>Course Policies</h2>
		<ul><li><b>Grading:</b>

		<p> Your final grade will depend on weekly homework assignments
		and three exams (2 midterms and a cumulative final). Letter
		grades will be awarded on a curve based on your total numerical
		score computed using the percentages below.  </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Homework: 30%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 1: 20%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 2: 20%</li> 
			<li>Final: 30% </li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Homework:</b>

		<p> Homework problems will be assigned with every lecture and
		collected weekly.  You are encouraged to attempt the problems
		as soon as possible, to solidify the material covered in
		lecture. Homework may be handed in during class, or turned in
		to the appropriate box in the math department mailroom, by 4pm
		on the due date.  Collaboration on homework assignments is
		allowed, and indeed encouraged. This means discussing problems,
		solution techniques, and comparing individual answers, not
		copying answers. Each student must write up their own homework
		individually.  <b>Please cite your collaborators and
		references used (apart from the textbook) on your homework
		assignments.</b> The grader may choose a random subset of problems
		to grade on each assignment.</p></li>

<li><b>Missed/Late assignments and exams:</b>

<p>
Late homework will not be permitted, except in cases of emergency accompanied
by a note from the Dean's office.  If you have a conflict, please arrange to
turn in your assignment early, or use it as your lowest homework score to be
dropped.  A missed exam may be made up only in the case of an emergency; the
make up will be an oral exam and may be more difficult than the original.
</p></li>

<li><b>Grade disputes:</b>
<p>
Please check over your exams and assignments when they are returned to you for
any grading mistakes (they happen!) and I will be glad to correct them. <b> 
Grade disputes will be considered for one week following the return of an
assignment.</b>  After one week, the grade is set.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for success:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Read the relevant material before class.</b>

	<p> I will post a reading assignment on the website corresponding to
	each lecture.  which should be completed <b>before</b> coming to class.
	You don't need to fully understand everything, but you'll find that
	having some familiarity with the subject before hearing the lecture is
	extremely helpful, and you are guaranteed to get more out of each class
	this way.</p></li>

	<li><b>Start homework problems early.</b>

	<p> Again, learning abstract mathematics takes time and above all,
	practice. The homework assignments are your chance to practice the
	material and develop your skills and intuition. Make an attempt at the
	homework problems as soon as possible after each lecture, then let them
	roll around in your head for a while if you don't get them right away.
	Sometimes the best mathematical insights come while you're walking down
	the street (or in the shower!) after you've put a problem in the back
	of your mind. If you wait until the last minute to start the homework
	assignments, you will set yourself up to do poorly.</p>

	<li><b> Be your own teacher.</b>

	<p>You are the person in the best position to identify which things you
	understand well and which things you feel a little hazy about. Try
	taking the role of instructor and see if you could explain the material
	to someone else (or yourself) and you'll quickly find out which things
	you are confused about.  While confusion is a (the?) natural state of
	learning mathematics (if you're not confused about something you
	probably aren't trying hard enough), don't let it persist
	-- work to become `unconfused'! (That way you can move on to be
	confused about something new...)</p></li>

	<li><b>Come to office hours.</b>

	<p>This is an invaluable time to get unconfused. Identify those things
	you don't understand very well, and ask me about them -- professors
	like to explain things! I'm also happy to discuss mathematics in
	general or anything else.</p></li>
