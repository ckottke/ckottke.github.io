		<h2>Description:</h2> 
		
		<p> Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear maps.  It
		is a foundational subject in mathematics, and of extremely wide
		use in fields such as economics, physics, biology, computer
		science, engineering. Math 540 is the honors version of the
		class, and is fast-paced and theoretically oriented.  We'll be
		covering lots of interesting material, but you should be
		prepared to spend a lot of time on this course.  </p>

		<p> Linear algebra is a very important subject, both for its
		use in theoretical mathematics and for it applicability in the
		real world. The computational side of linear algebra is quite
		important, but due to time constraints, computations will not
		be the primary focus of the lectures in this course.  Homework
		sets will consist of two different sorts of problems.  Some
		problems will be theoretical, and you'll learn to construct
		your own proofs. These will generally build on material that
		we've covered in class.  Other problems will ask you to gain
		familiarity with computational aspects of linear algebra that
		we discuss only briefly in class.  </p>
		
	<p> We will use the same exams and (mostly the same) homework problems
	as Section 1 (taught by Joe Silverman), and will try to keep to more or
	less the same schedule.</p>

		<h2>Course Policies</h2>
		<ul><li><b>Grading:</b>

		<p> Your final grade will depend on weekly homework assignments
		and three exams (2 midterms and a cumulative final). Letter
		grades will be awarded on a curve based on your total numerical
		score computed using the percentages below.  </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Homework: 15%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 1: 25%</li> 
			<li>Midterm 2: 25%</li> 
			<li>Final: 35% </li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Homework:</b>

		<p> Homework problems will be assigned with every lecture and
		collected weekly.  You are encouraged to attempt the problems
		as soon as possible, to solidify the material covered in
		lecture. Homework may be handed in during class, or turned in
		to the appropriate box in the math department mailroom, by 4pm
		on the due date.  Collaboration on homework assignments is
		allowed, and indeed encouraged. This means discussing problems,
		solution techniques, and comparing individual answers, not
		copying answers. Each student must write up their own homework
		individually.  <b>Please cite your collaborators and
		references used (apart from the textbook) on your homework
		assignments.</b></p></li>

<li><b>Missed/Late assignments and exams:</b>

<p>
Late homework will not be permitted, except in cases of emergency accompanied
by a note from the Dean's office.  If you have a conflict, please arrange to
turn in your assignment early, or use it as your lowest homework score to be
dropped.  A missed exam may be made up only in the case of an emergency; the
make up will be an oral exam and may be more difficult than the original.
</p></li>

<li><b>Grade disputes:</b>
<p>
Please check over your exams and assignments when they are returned to you for
any grading mistakes (they happen!) and I will be glad to correct them. <b> 
Grade disputes will be considered for one week following the return of an
assignment.</b>  After one week, the grade is set.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for success:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Read the relevant material before class.</b>

	<p> I will post a reading assignment on the website corresponding to
	each lecture.  which should be completed <b>before</b> coming to class.
	You don't need to fully understand everything, but you'll find that
	having some familiarity with the subject before hearing the lecture is
	extremely helpful, and you are guaranteed to get more out of each class
	this way.</p></li>

	<li><b>Start homework problems early.</b>

	<p> Learning abstract mathematics takes time and above all,
	practice. The homework assignments are your chance to practice the
	material and develop your skills and intuition. Make an attempt at the
	homework problems as soon as possible after each lecture, then let them
	roll around in your head for a while if you don't get them right away.
	Sometimes the best mathematical insights come while you're walking down
	the street (or in the shower!) after you've put a problem in the back
	of your mind. If you wait until the last minute to start the homework
	assignments, you will set yourself up to do poorly.</p>

	<li><b> Be your own teacher.</b>

	<p>You are the person in the best position to identify which things you
	understand well and which things you feel a little hazy about. Try
	taking the role of instructor and see if you could explain the material
	to someone else (or yourself) and you'll quickly find out which things
	you are confused about.  While confusion is a (the?) natural state of
	learning mathematics (if you're not confused about something you
	probably aren't trying hard enough), don't let it persist
	-- work to become `unconfused'! (That way you can move on to be
	confused about something new...)</p></li>

	<li><b>Come to office hours.</b>

	<p>This is an invaluable time to get unconfused. Identify those things
	you don't understand very well, and ask me about them -- professors
	like to explain things! I'm also happy to discuss mathematics in
	general or anything else.</p></li>
